## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a sample crime dataset containing information about various crimes, including their types, locations, and dates.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Understanding and Cleaning

- **Load the dataset** and inspect the columns and data types.
- **Handle missing values** by either dropping rows/columns or imputing values.
- **Convert data types** for columns like dates.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualize crime counts** per year and per crime type.
- **Plot trends** and identify patterns in the data.

### 3. Feature Selection and Transformation

- **Encode categorical variables** using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Select relevant features** for the prediction model.

### 4. Model Building

- **Split the data** into training and testing sets.
- **Train a model** (e.g., RandomForestRegressor) on the training set.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- **Evaluate the model** using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
- **Make predictions** on the test set and compare with actual values.

### 6. Prediction and Analysis

- **Predict future crime rates** using the trained model.
- **Analyze and interpret** the prediction results.

## PowerBI Visualizations

PowerBI is used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards for the crime data. Follow these steps to create and view the PowerBI reports:

1. **Load the data** into PowerBI.
2. **Create visualizations** such as bar charts, line charts, and maps to explore crime trends and patterns.
3. **Publish the reports** to the PowerBI service for sharing and collaboration.
